# Data Exploration and Visualization

## Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

### Objective
The objective of this task is to learn how to load, inspect, and visualize a dataset in order to understand data trends, distributions, and relationships between features. This task focuses on basic data analysis and visualization techniques using Python.

---

### Dataset
The dataset used in this task is the **Iris Dataset**, a well-known dataset commonly used for introductory data science and machine learning tasks.

The dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

**Features included:**
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width
- Species (target label)

The dataset can be loaded using:
- `seaborn` library, or
- A CSV file downloaded manually.

---

### Project Instructions
The following steps were performed:

1. **Load the Dataset**
   - Loaded the Iris dataset using the `pandas` library.

2. **Initial Data Inspection**
   - Displayed the shape of the dataset.
   - Printed column names.
   - Displayed the first few rows using `.head()`.

3. **Summary Statistics**
   - Used `.info()` to inspect data types and missing values.
   - Used `.describe()` to generate statistical summaries.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Created scatter plots to analyze relationships between features.
   - Used histograms to visualize value distributions.
   - Used box plots to identify potential outliers.

5. **Visualization Tools**
   - Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for plotting and visual analysis.
